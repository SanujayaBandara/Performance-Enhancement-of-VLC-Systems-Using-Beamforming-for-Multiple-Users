# Performance-Enhancement-of-VLC-Systems-Using-Beamforming-for-Multiple-Users
Designed and implemented a motorized VLC system with beamforming. Used beacon signals from 3 receivers to identify user locations via photodiode signal strength. The transmitter auto-rotates to optimize data delivery. Performance evaluated using BER analysis and real-time testing.
